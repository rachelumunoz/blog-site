Hi, I'm Rachel and I'm a software developer with a background in the arts.

I studied art at UCLA which is a program that focuses on creating meaning through intention. Through taking a step back and analyzing the context of artworks (the who, what, where, when, and why) along with how artworks look, it instilled the idea that <i> art can be anything</i>.


I found myself pursuing software development as a new way to create artworks. I was excited to find that my favorite parts of creating objects of art, i.e. research, problem solving, and collaboration are equally important in creating software!

As a recent Dev Bootcamp grad I've been continuing to add to my skillset by building, building, building. I enjoy learning new concepts such as: investigating the nuances of JavaScript, learning about abstract data structures, along with programming paradigms such as functional programming.

In my free time I enjoy running, lifting, <a target="_blank" href="http://cargocollective.com/rachelmunoz"> photography</a>, cooking, and writing.
