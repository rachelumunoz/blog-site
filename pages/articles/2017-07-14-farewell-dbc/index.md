description: Thanks DBC
---

When I first heard the news, I was shocked. It was not even a year ago that I was spending nights on end learning how to code in the 8th floor highrise of the San Diego campus. A bit frustrated, a bit overwhelmed, but reassured that I had the ability to write software instilled by the values set by DBC. 

Without DBC, I wouldn’t be where I am today.  Before enrolling I had no programming experience. Through the 19 week course I was taught not only how to think programmatically, but how to work collaboratively, and most importantly I learned how to learn.

Without DBC, I wouldn’t have thought that programming was something that I could pursue. I would’ve continued with the mindset that I couldn't be a programmer because of stereotypes and the status quo. But through DBC I learned of the unfortunate circumstances I faced due to my gender, sexual orientation, and ethnic background. Through the support of alumni, staff, and instructors at DBC I was able to find the courage and belief that although I hadn’t been coding since I was in the womb, I, too, could be a software developer.

I am grateful that I was able to attend Dev Bootcamp and it saddens me that others won’t have the opportunity to attend such a life changing program. I am proud to be an alumni of DBC and proud to be a part of an organization that has changed so many lives for the better.
