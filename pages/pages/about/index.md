Hi, I'm Rachel and I'm a software developer with a background in the arts.

I studied art in a program that focuses on creating meaning through intention. Through taking a step back and analyzing the context of artworks (the who, what, where, when, and why) along with how the artwork looks, I found myself pursuing web development as a new way to create artworks--a way to create meaningful things that have a large impact.

As a recent Dev Bootcamp grad I've been continuing learning full stack web development by translating what we learned in Ruby on Rails to Node.js, Express, and React. I enjoy learning new concepts such as investigating the nuances of JavaScript, data structures and algorithms, along with functional programming.

In my free time I enjoy running, lifting, <a target="_blank" href="http://cargocollective.com/rachelmunoz"> photography</a>, cooking, and writing.
