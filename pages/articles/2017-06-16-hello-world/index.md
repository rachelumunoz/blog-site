Hi, and welcome to the new site!

Hello, Gatsby?

You may be thinking, "what is a Gatsby?"

Gatsby is the static generator I used to build this site. Gatsby uses React components and React Router to create dynamic blogs and static sites.

I thought Gatsby was a perfect choice for an all inclusive site where I can write about software, show off software I have built, and put a face to my name. With this site I can now keep it all my links and blog posts nicely packaged in one place!

If you'd like to check out my older blog posts, here's a <a href="https://medium.com/@r_munoz" target="_blank"> link to my Medium </a> where they were originally posted.

Upcoming for this blog:
  * redesign using a custom template (currently using the Lumen Starter) 
  * ability to add comments
